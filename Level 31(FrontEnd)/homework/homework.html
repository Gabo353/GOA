                in the Western TV series Rawhide, Eastwood rose to international fame with his role as the "Man with No
                Name" in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero cop
                Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among others,
                have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.[4][5] Elected in 1986, Eastwood served for
                two years as the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California.Eastwood's greatest commercial successes are the
                adventure comedy Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and its action comedy sequel Any Which Way You Can
                (1980).[6] Other popular Eastwood films include the Westerns Hang 'Em High (1968), The Outlaw Josey
                Wales (1976) and Pale Rider (1985), the action-war film Where Eagles Dare (1968), the prison film Escape
                from Alcatraz (1979), the war film Heartbreak Ridge (1986), the action film In the Line of Fire (1993),
                and the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County (1995). More recent works include Gran Torino
                (2008), The Mule (2018), and Cry Macho (2021). Since 1967, Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has
                produced all but four of his American films.</p>

            <p>After graduating high school, Eastwood has said he worked as a lumberjack and forest firefighter in
                Oregon, and a steelworker in Texas. He was drafted during the war in Korea and sent to Fort Ord on
                Monterey Bay in California for basic training. He was never deployed for combat; he stuck around as a
                swimming instructor, and spent his nights and weekends working as a bouncer at the NCO club.
                Returning to Fort Ord from Seattle following a weekend leave in the fall of 1951, Eastwood ran into some
                trouble. “On the way back, they had one plane, a Douglas AD, sort of a torpedo bomber of the World War
                II
                vintage, and I thought I’d hitch on that," Eastwood recalled. “Everything went wrong. Radios went out.
                Oxygen
                ran out. And finally we ran out of fuel up around Point Reyes, California, and went in the ocean. So we
                went
                swimming. It was late October, November. Very cold water. found out many years later that it was a white
                shark
                breeding ground, but I’m glad I didn’t know that at the time or I’d have just died.”Eastwood was still
                looking
                to make his movie debut on October 26, 1954 when he wrote a letter to Oscar-winning moviemaker Billy
                Wilder,
                thanking the director for taking the time to meet with him the previous week and warning him that the
                one video
                Universal could provide of him was a "difficult" interview where he was "not very good, even though I
                was given
                a contract on the strength of it. When the time comes for casting, I would appreciate so much your
                letting me
                talk with you rather than seeing this test, for I have improved in every way since that time. I feel the
                qualities you might be seeking can better be found in a personal interview." Wilder cast Jimmy Stewart
                in the
                role.</p>
