        The Dears performed in Toronto in October 2001 with Sloan.[3] In 2001 and 2002, they released the EPs Orchestral Pop Noir Romantique and Protest, respectively, as well as a collection of unreleased songs, Nor the Dahlias. In 2003 they released their second full-length album No Cities Left, and a string of shows at SXSW '04 launched their international career.[4]</p>
